<!-- I am an assistant professor in the [Computer Science and Engineering][cse] department at UC Santa Cruz. I design architectures, systems, and algorithms to improve communication efficiency, which in turn increases performance, saves energy, and reduces cost for data-intensive applications. More broadly, I am interested in: computer architecture, data movement optimization, memory interconnects, open-source hardware design, and graph algorithms. -->

<!-- I design architectures to improve communication efficiency for data-intensive applications. More broadly, I am interested in: computer architecture, data movement optimization, memory interconnects, open-source hardware design, and graph algorithms. -->

<p>An enthusiast reader and a novice for Technology, History, Physics and Biology and everything that falls into the sciences of the world. A profound interest in the field of Data Structures and Algorithms. Curious about finding patterns in a large set of data and make respective data-driven decisions.</p>

<p>I am working with <a href="https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~cormac/">Prof Cormac Flanagan</a> for the course of CSE20, where I teach concepts on the Python Programming Language. Actively studying topics related to Machine Learning, Data Science, Algorithms and Data Structures.</p>

<p>Currently working on a Deep Learning project where I take inputs, deploy an object detection model that recognizes features from the image and conveys an output confidence score based on the model's accuracy on the train dataset. It is a sign language interpreter that translates gestures in real-time dataframe. The model is based upon the YOLO architecture that stands for You-Only-Look-Once, that is a Neural Network that calculates probabilities for each region in the image.</p>
